Analysis various wines to come up with a valide investment strategy.

1Ô∏è‚É£ The exploratory analysis focussed on understanding the data.
- The price was not normaly distributed
- time, type and rating all influenced the price of wines

2Ô∏è‚É£ We utilized linear regression to compute the expected return of the different types of wine.
- red, white and sparkling wine seem to have an interesting risk-return profile for investment
- rose wine is more risky with less returns

3Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio optimization resulted in a portfolio of:
- **39%** white wine
- **38%** red wine
- **23%** sparkling wine

This portfolio has an **expected annualized return of 28% and a volatility of 40%**
